# hubot-scalarium

Scalarium Plugin for Hubot

## Installation
Just put the file into the correct place, if you don't know where the 'correct place' is, please be patient. I'll add the plugin into the official [hubot-scripts](https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts) repo as soon as it's some state i would call stable.

## WARNING!
This script is under heavy development, as far as i know at the moment, there are some false-positives in the deploy responses and so on. So when you don't want to debug 3rd party code. DO NOT TOUCH THIS PLUGIN (at least for a moment) ;)
